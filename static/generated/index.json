    "prompt": "A professional startup office in a Nordic city, filled with soft natural northern light from large windows. A diverse team of 3-4 people collaborates around a wooden table, engaged in a genuine discussion. Their body language is open and relaxed, with subtle, authentic expressions. The environment is minimalistic and airy, with Nordic design touches—neutral tones, occasional green plants, and stone or wood textures. The composition uses generous negative space and asymmetric balance, with some architectural details or blurred team members in the background. The mood is calm, focused, and quietly confident, evoking authentic workplace culture and human connection.",

    "prompt": "A modern Stockholm startup team of 3-4 people collaborating authentically in a bright, airy workspace with large windows and abundant natural northern light. The team is engaged in a thoughtful discussion around a shared table, with genuine micro-expressions and relaxed, open body language. The environment features subtle Scandinavian design elements—minimalist furniture, touches of greenery, and neutral tones with hints of purple or emerald accents. The composition uses asymmetric balance and generous negative space (40-60% of the frame), placing the team off-center with layered depth: blurred plants or architectural details in the foreground, workspace context in the background. The overall mood is one of quiet confidence and purposeful focus, captured with a cool-neutral color temperature and subtly desaturated, editorial processing.",
