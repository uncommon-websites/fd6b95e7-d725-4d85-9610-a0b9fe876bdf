    "prompt": "A professional startup office in a Nordic city, filled with soft natural northern light from large windows. A diverse team of 3-4 people collaborates around a wooden table, engaged in a genuine discussion. Their body language is open and relaxed, with subtle, authentic expressions. The environment is minimalistic and airy, with Nordic design touchesâ€”neutral tones, occasional green plants, and stone or wood textures. The composition uses generous negative space and asymmetric balance, with some architectural details or blurred team members in the background. The mood is calm, focused, and quietly confident, evoking authentic workplace culture and human connection.",
